In statistics, causal inference refers to 
regresion model that aims to predict results 
of interventions. For example, to predict
the effect of mammography screening
in deacreasing the death rate by breast cancer. 
Medical treatments all need these studies, so
by the end of this test you'll have an basic
but rigorous understanding of what this means. 

Causal inferences can be based on  
randomnized controlled experiemts, observational studies,
 or natural experiments. 
The main problem in infering that the data 
shows that a treatment X, causes, causes an effect Y, is 
that confounding factos Z, influencing 
X and Y. Unless these are somehow taken into 
account, it is not clear what X really tells
about Y. 

Let us consider the example of answering if 
X=mammography causes Y={decreases death rate by breast cancer}. 
Confoundings in this case might that richer 
women tend to get tested more. Another one is pregnancy,
apparently it has a protective effect, specially
on earlly first pregnancy. In 1960s, mammography
was developed to increases survival changes 
of people with cancer. 
Does mammography speeds up detection enough
to matter? To answer this question the first large-scale
ramdonized experiment was conducted, by the HIP Health
insurance plan in New York).  62, 000 women (ages 40 to 64) 
were splitted in two equal 
size groups, at random. This ensured that, up 
to an small random error, the groups had a similar 
number of mothers and non-mothers, there were large numbers
of rich and poorer ones on each groups. Next, a 
periodic mammography was offered to one group, the 
treatment group,  and not the other, the control group.

Mammography has been widely adopted, because 
experiment like this showed that, substancially, 
fewer women died of breast cancer in the treatment 
group that in the control group. Warning: this 
does not mean that mammography screening 
is equally effective for everyone nor that 
it is always recommended! If you considering 
testing better have a complete look at this
[Link]({{ https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/rethinking-the-screening-mammogram-2018062814151 }}),
where you can find more complete look at 
screening recommendations. 

Although, in medical and social sciences, 
ramdonized controlled experiments the most 
effective controlling confoundings these are 
not always possible. For ethical reasons, it would 
be wrong to ask a treatment group to Tobacco smoking (X) 
to determine if this increases the risk of 
diseases like lung cancer or heart attacks (Y). 
In this as similar cases, a observational 
study can be performed, this is defined as a study
where the investigators does not have control 
over X. 

Examples of coufoundings in the case of Tobacco smoking 
are sex, as men are more proponence 
to heart attacks, and air pollution, which 
increases in cities. To deal confoundings, such observationa 
studies make comparisons separately women and men, yonger and old,
and similarly for any other confounding. 
There is overwhelming evidence that in 
the smoking (treatment groups) smokings increases 
the risk of lung cancer. 

Finally, a natural experiment is an observation 
study, where assigment to treatment or control group
is as if randonized by nature (without the need
of intervention). A historical example 
of casual inference is the London epidemy of cholera,
in 1848. In 1855, about 20 years before Pasteur and
Koch provided evidence that germs can cause diseases,
John Snow performed used a natural experiment to provide 
strong evidence that cholera is a waterborn infection
disease.

In a nutshell, Snow noticed that the houses in London 
where peope die more often of the diseases drank 
their water from the same sources, those which 
contained sewage of a town exerts. Other house were
the prevalence of deaths were lower drank water coming
from companies with higher standards of water 
purifying. Crucially, the preferences of water 
were distributed as random. Water distribution and preferences 
did not depend on social status, profession, etc. 

To review details on the contents of this post 
look at the book of D. A. Freedman on Statistical Models.  
Hopefully this post give you a glance at the difficultly 
of casual inference.
