In statistics, causal inference refers to 
regresion model that aims to predict results 
of interventions. For example, to predict
the effect of mammography screening
in deacreasing the death rate by breast cancer. 
Medical treatments all need these studies, so
by the end of this test you'll have an basic
but rigorous understanding of what this means. 

Causal inferences can be based on  
randomnized controlled experiemts, observational studies,
 or natural experiments. 
The main problem in infering that the data 
shows that a treatment X, causes, causes an effect Y, is 
that confounding factos Z, influencing 
X and Y. Unless these are somehow taken into 
account, it is not clear what X really tells
about Y. 

Let us consider the example of answering if 
X=mammography causes Y={decreases death rate by breast cancer}. 
Confoundings in this case might that richer 
women tend to get tested more. Another one is pregnancy,
apparently it has a protective effect, specially
on earlly first pregnancy. In the early 1960s, mammography
was develope. Does mammography speeds up detection enough
to matter? To answer this question the first large-scale
ramdonized experiment was conducted, by the HIP Health
insurance plan in New York).  62, 000 women 
of ages 40 to 64, were splitted in two equal 
size groups, at random. This ensured that, up 
to an small random error, the groups had a similar 
number of mothers and non-mothers, there were large numbers
of rich and poorer ones on each groups. Next, a 
periodic mammography was offered to one group, the 
treatment group,  and not the other, the control group.
