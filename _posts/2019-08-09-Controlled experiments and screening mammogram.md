In statistics, causal inference refers to 
regresion model that aims to predict results 
of interventions. For example, to predict
the effect of mammography screening
in deacreasing the death rate by breast cancer. 
Medical treatments all need these studies, so
by the end of this test you'll have an basic
but rigorous understanding of what this means. 

Causal inferences can be based on  
randomnized controlled experiemts, observational studies,
 or natural experiments. 
The main problem in infering that the data 
shows that a treatment X, causes, causes an effect Y, is 
that confounding factos Z, influencing 
X and Y. Unless these are somehow taken into 
account, it is not clear what X really tells
about Y. 

Let us consider the example of answering if 
X=mammography causes Y={decreases death rate by breast cancer}. 
Confoundings in this case might that richer 
women tend to get tested more. Another one is pregnancy,
apparently it has a protective effect, specially
on earlly first pregnancy. In 1960s, mammography
was developed to increases survival changes 
of people with cancer. 
Does mammography speeds up detection enough
to matter? To answer this question the first large-scale
ramdonized experiment was conducted, by the HIP Health
insurance plan in New York).  62, 000 women (ages 40 to 64) 
were splitted in two equal 
size groups, at random. This ensured that, up 
to an small random error, the groups had a similar 
number of mothers and non-mothers, there were large numbers
of rich and poorer ones on each groups. Next, a 
periodic mammography was offered to one group, the 
treatment group,  and not the other, the control group.

Mammography has been widely adopted, because 
experiment like this showed that, substancially, 
fewer women died of breast cancer in the treatment 
group that in the control group. Warning: this 
does not mean that mammography screening 
is equally effective for everyone nor that 
it is always recommended! If you considering 
testing better have a complete look at this

where you can find more complete look at 
screening recommendations. 

Although, in medical adn social sciences, 
ramdonized controlled experiments the most 
effective controlling confoundings these are 
not always possible. For ethica reasons, it would 
be wrong to ask a treatment group to smoking (X) 
to determine if this increases the risk of 
diseases like lung cancer or heart attacks (Y). 
Several confunding influenciate such studies. 
Examples are the sex, as men are more proponence 
to heart attacks, and air pollution, which 
increases in cities. To deal confoundings, such observationa 
studies make comparisons separately women and men, yonger and old,
and similarly for any other confounding.
