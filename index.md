This site aims to provide useful information to answer this question.
The context: many relevant problems of our lifes are affected by chaos, 
randomness, uncertainties, etc. So it would be 
better to have a strategy to which do not depend on the incomplete
understanding that our theories have about pretty much every personal
and social problem. 

To illustrate this point let us consider the classic don't be a turkey tale:

There was a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers
show any signs of wanting to eat it to proceeed with a scape plan. 
As time passed by, it theorize it'll never happend; one day they did eat it. 

This classic tale nicely illustrates how the understanding one attains
during life can fail us. It is not hard to find examples of such situation
at a personal level and within groups, e.g. wars, economic crisis, 
technological breakthroughts, people behaving differently 
than what was expected, etc.

This site aims to provide formal accurate information that help 
us to identify our lack of understanding. This is not being a turkey. 
The do not aim to provide understanding but rather to create help 
readers to identify their biases,
