This site aims to provide useful information to answer this question.
The context: many relevant problems of our lifes are affected by chaos, 
randomness, uncertainties, etc. So it would be 
better to have a strategy to which do not depend on the incomplete
understanding that our theories have about pretty much every personal
and social problem. To illustrate let us consider the 
don't be a turkey tale

There was a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers
show any signs of wanting to eat it to proceeed with a scape plan. 
As time passed by, it theorize it'll never happend; one day they did eat it. 
End.

This classic tale nicely illustrates a wrong strategy towars undertainty 
can hurt us. It is not hard to find similar situation
at a personal level or beyond: wars, economic crisis, consequences
technological breakthroughts, people behaving differently 
than what was expected, etc.

On the contrary, there are strategies that allow someone to 
survive and even improve in the presence of the lack of 
understanding! For example, it is good for family to have savings 
evendo if his understanding is that busssiness is going well!
It will, likely, will make their lifes happier in the long run.

There are tons of references that provide such material, and we will 
happily refer the reader to such references. However, there are holes 
in such knowledge.
