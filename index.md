This site aims to provide useful information to answer this question.
Within which context you ask. The point is how to make decisions 
when we know most of problems have some level of undertainty or randomness.
Crucially, some strategies are better 
than other to deal with these facts of life. This site aims to provide 
some knowledge that help us with such decisions or at least 
identify the undertenties and randomness within our contemporary lifes. 


To illustrate our this aim, let us consider the next
don't be more or less known turkey tale:

There was a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers
show any signs of wanting to eat it to proceeed with a scape plan. 
As time passed by, it theorize it'll never happend; one day they did eat it. 
End.

This classic tale nicely illustrates a wrong strategy towars undertainty 
can hurt us. It is not hard to find similar situation
at a personal level or beyond: wars, economic crisis, consequences
technological breakthroughts, people behaving differently 
than what was expected, etc.

On the contrary, there are strategies that allow someone to 
survive and even improve in the presence of the lack of 
understanding! For example, it is good for family to have savings 
evendo if his understanding is that busssiness is going well!
It will, likely, will make peoples lifes happier in the long run.

There are tons of references that provide such material, and we aim to 
make accesible. Why bother you might ask. Well, when possible, 
we prefer not to be turkeys and we also do not want you to be one!
