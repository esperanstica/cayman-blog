This non-profit organization aims to provide useful information to answer this question.
Within which context you ask. The point is how  
to deal with problems that have some level of undertainty or randomness.
Crucially, even with a incomplete understanding fo such problems, 
some desicions are better than other to deal with these . This site aims to provide 
materials that help us make such good decisions identify the 
undertenties and randomness within our contemporary lifes. 

To illustrate our this aim, let us consider the next
don't be more or less known turkey tale:

There was a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers
show any signs of wanting to eat it to proceeed with its escape plan. 
As time passed by, it theorize it'll never happend as farmer were nice; 
one day they did eat it. End.

This classic tale nicely illustrates how a wrong strategy towars undertainty 
can hurt us. It is not hard to find similar situations
at a personal level or beyond: wars, economic crisis, consequences
game-changer technologies, people behaving differently 
than what was expected, health treatments, etc.

On the contrary, sometimes there are strategies that make 
robust and even improve in the presence of the lack of 
understanding! For example, it is good for family to have savings 
evendo if his understanding is that busssiness is going well!
It will, likely, will make people happier in the long run.

There are already tons of references that provide such material, rather than
contributing this organization aims to make such references accesible to everyone. 
Why bother you may ask. Well, we prefer us not to turkeys and rather be 
prepared to deal with complex problems such as climate change, finantial crisis, 
misuse of technological developments, etc. 

To keep us focus on the main subject, we prefer do not have any politic, 
religious and moral views. These are importnat matters of course but rather than 
guide people towards our posture we prefer only to provide tools for 
individual to make inform decisions. When you detect a bias, reasoning problems,
misconceptions or potential improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of them. 

Hope you have fun on this sites.Thanks for visiting us.
