Esperantica is a non-profict project aiming to make accesible to everyone statistical and other tools 
to identify uncertainty and randomness in modern problems, and how to strategicly decide in their prensece. 
To illustrate this better, let us consider the classic tale:

There was once a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers show signs of wanting to eat. As time passed by, it thought it'll never happend as farmer were nice to it; one day they did eat it. End.

This tale nicely illustrates how a poor strategy towards undertainty can hurt us. It is not hard to find similar stories at a personal level and beyond. For example stories about people behaving differently than what was expected, wars, finantial crisis, careless use of new technologies, health treatments, etc.

On the contrary, some strategies can make you robust and even improve when we have an imperfect understanding of a problem! For example, it is wise having savins even is our busssiness is going well! and it is better to try to stop climate change, even if studies do not show conlusive evidence as waiting for conclusive proofs is being a Turkey. 

There are already tons of references that provide great material, our goal is making such references visible and accesible to everyone. Why bother you may ask. Well, we very much prefer you not being a turkey and rather be prepared to deal with complex problems such as climate change, finantial crisis, harming use of technology, etc.

To keep us focus on the main subject, we prefer do not adopt politic, religious and moral views. These are importnat matters but rather than presenting our views prefer just to provide tools and awareness for decision making. When you detect a bias, reasoning issues, misconceptions or potential improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of these.

Hope you have fun! Thanks for taking some of your precious time to visit us!
