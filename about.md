This non-profit organization aims to provide useful information to answer this question. In which context you ask. The point is how to deal with problems that have some level of undertainty or randomness. Crucially, even with a incomplete understanding fo such problems, some desicions are better than other to deal with these. This site aims to provide materials that help us make such good decisions identify the undertenties and randomness within our contemporary lifes.

To illustrate our this aim, let us consider the next don't be more or less known turkey tale:

There was once a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers show any signs of wanting to eat it to proceeed with its escape plan. As time passed by, it theorize it'll never happend as farmer were nice to it; one day they did eat it. End.

This tale nicely illustrates how a wrong strategy towards undertainty can hurt us. It is not hard to find similar stories at a personal level and beyond. For example stories about people behaving differently than what was expected, wars, finantial crisis, careless use of new technologies, health treatments, etc.

On the contrary, sometimes there are strategies that make robust and even improve in the presence of the lack of understanding! For example, it is good for family to have savings evendo if his understanding is that busssiness is going well! It is better to try fight climate change just in case it is possible! These decisions will, likely, make people happier in the long run.

There are already tons of references that provide great material, rather than contributing this site aims to make such references accesible to everyone. Why bother you may ask. Well, we prefer us not to turkeys and rather be prepared to deal with complex problems such as climate change, finantial crisis, harming use of technology, etc.

To keep us focus on the main subject, we prefer do not have any politic, religious and moral views. These are importnat matters of course but rather than forcing our views we only to provide tools and awareness for decision making. When you detect a bias, reasoning issues, misconceptions or potential improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of these.

Hope you have fun! Thanks for taking some of your precious time to visit us!
