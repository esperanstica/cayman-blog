Esperantica is a non-profict project aiming to make accesible to everyone statistical and many other similar tools 
to identify uncertainty and randomness of social problems, and how to strategicly decide in their presence. 
To illustrate this better, let us consider a classic tale:

There was once a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers show signs of wanting to eat. It planned escaping
at the slightest concern. After some time, it thought it'll never happend as farmers were nice; one day they did eat it. End.

This tale nicely illustrates how a poor strategy towards undertainty can hurt us. It is not hard to find this pattern in many  stories at a personal level and beyond. For example stories about people, finantial markets, health treatments, nature and new technologies having unexpected results.

Fortunately, often there exists strategies can make you robust and even improve when we have an imperfect understanding of a problem! For example, it is wise having savins even is our busssiness is going well! and it is better to try to stop climate change, and not waiting as the Turkey did. 

There are already many excelent references that provide great material on these subjects, our goal is to make these visible and accesible to everyone. Why? Well, we very much prefer this way, hoping if we are better prepared to deal with complex problems such as climate change, referendums, peace we will all have a better time. 

To keep us focus, we prefer do not adopt politic, religious and moral views. These are important matters 
of course but rather present hard facts than views. We encourage you to be critic of our content, when you detect biases, reasoning issues, misconceptions or improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of these.

Hope you have fun! Thanks for taking some of your precious time to visit us!
