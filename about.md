Esperantica is a non-profict project aiming to make accesible to everyone statistical and many other similar tools 
to identify uncertainty and randomness of social problems, and how to strategicly decide in their presence. 
To illustrate this better, let us consider a classic tale:

There was once a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers show signs of wanting to eat. It planned escaping
at the slightest concern. After some time, it thought it'll never happend as farmers were nice; one day they did eat it. End.

This tale nicely illustrates how a poor strategy towards undertainty can hurt us. It is not hard to find this pattern in many  stories at a personal level and beyond. For example stories about people, finantial markets, health treatments, nature and new technologies having unexpected results.

Fortunately, often there exists strategies that can make you robust and even rescilient towards 
uncertainty and randomness! For example, it is wise having savins even is our busssiness is going well just like it is better to try to stop climate change, and not to wait as the Turkey did. 

There are already many excelent references that provide great material on these subjects, our goal is to make these visible and accesible to everyone. Why? Well, we very much prefer this way, to be all better equipt to deal with complex issues such referendums, peace, frauds, climate change. This way we all have it better. 

Worth mentioning, we will make an effort to avoid any politic, religious and moral views. 
These are important matters of course but we rather focus on the tools. Let us all be critic of each other. 
When you detect biases, reasoning issues, misconceptions or improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of these.

Hope you have fun! Thanks for taking some of your precious time to visit us!
