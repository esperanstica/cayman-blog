Esperantica is a non-profict project aiming to provide useful information to deal with
problems where uncertainty and randomness do not allow us to have a bullet-proof undertanding.  
The crucial point to realise is that even if one can't understand everything
some strategies and decisions are better than others.  

To illustrate this better, let us consider the classic tale:

There was once a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers show signs of wanting to eat. As time passed by, it thought it'll never happend as farmer were nice to it; one day they did eat it. End.

This tale nicely illustrates how a poor strategy towards undertainty can hurt us. It is not hard to find similar stories at a personal level and beyond. For example stories about people behaving differently than what was expected, wars, finantial crisis, careless use of new technologies, health treatments, etc.

On the contrary, some strategies can make you robust and even improve in the presence of the lack of understanding! For example, it is good having savins even is busssiness is going well and it is better to try fight climate change just we can stop it! These decisions will, likely, make people happier in the long run.

There are already tons of references that provide great material, and our goal is making such references accesible to everyone. Why bother you may ask. Well, we very much prefer you not being a turkey and rather be prepared to deal with complex problems such as climate change, finantial crisis, harming use of technology, etc.

To keep us focus on the main subject, we prefer do not have any politic, religious and moral views. Indeed, these are importnat matters but rather than forcing our views we only to provide tools and awareness for decision making. When you detect a bias, reasoning issues, misconceptions or potential improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of these.

Hope you have fun! Thanks for taking some of your precious time to visit us!
