Esperantica is a non-profict project aiming to make accesible to everyone statistical and many other similar tools 
to identify uncertainty and randomness of many of our everyday problems, and how to strategicly decide in their presence. 
To illustrate this better, let us consider a classic tale:

There was once a Turkey, a cautious one. Each day it checked if farmers show signs of wanting to eat. After some time it decided not to escape, it thought it'll never happend as farmer were nice; one day they did eat it. End.

This tale nicely illustrates how a poor strategy towards undertainty can hurt us. It is not hard to find this pattern in many  stories at a personal level and beyond. For example stories about people behaving differently than expected, wars, finantial crisis, implications of new technological, health treatments, etc.

On the contrary, some strategies can make you robust and even improve when we have an imperfect understanding of a problem! For example, it is wise having savins even is our busssiness is going well! and it is better to try to stop climate change, even if studies do not understand, as waiting for conclusive proofs can turn you into a Turkey. 

There are already tons of references that provide great material on these subjects, our goal is making these visible and accesible to everyone. Why? Well, we very much prefer you to live happily in complex, to be prepared to deal with complex problems such as climate change, democratic elections, finantial crisis, being harmed by technologies, etc.

To keep us focus on the main subject, we prefer do not adopt politic, religious and moral views. These are important matters 
of course but rather than presenting our views we prefer you to make your own decisions. When you detect a bias, reasoning issues, misconceptions or potential improvements we kinly beg us to make us aware of these.

Hope you have fun! Thanks for taking some of your precious time to visit us!
